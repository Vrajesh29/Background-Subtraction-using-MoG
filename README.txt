To run the code, you need to mount your drive on colab. Make sure that you create the folders by the name as specified by me while extracting/writing files.
Kindly refer the drive link attached in the report for more clarity of images. The drive contains frames of original image, implemented algorithm, MOG, MOG2.

The google drive contains 138 images along with video for implemented algorithm, MOG, and MOG2. It also contains original video and original frames.
